## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Noah.

I graduated from Michigan State University in spring 2024 with a B.S. in Statistics and minors in Data Science and Computational Math, Science, Engineering (CMSE). From my studies, I have experience using Python, SQL, and R on school projects and assignmets. On the side, I have taught myself Power BI and Excel; on September 2025 I passed the PL-300 exam to become Microsoft certified with Power BI.

I have experience using Python, Power BI, SQL, Excel, and R.

[Bike-Share Membership](https://github.com/leenoah390/coursera-case-studies/blob/main/Case%20Study%201%20City%20Bikes.md) (Jul 2025)\
Created a Power BI report to track ride-share membership trends in Chicago for a bike-share company over the course of a year. Also made recommendations on how to increase membership counts and to introduce new tiers of membership.

[How do Users Bellabeat?](https://github.com/leenoah390/coursera-case-studies/blob/main/Case%20Study%202%20Bellabeat.ipynb) (Jun 2025)\
Using data from Bellabeat, a smart device company catered towards women and their health, I created a report with Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) to tracks health trends of women using such devices. With such findings, recommendations on marketing and how to encourage more physical activity were written.

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/leenoah390/tidytuesday_practice) (2025)\
Weekly challenges to perform simple data analysis. Refer to repo readmes to view source data per week.\

[World Happiness Report: Over the years](https://github.com/leenoah390/World_Happiness_Report/blob/main/world_happiness_report_all.ipynb) (Dec 2023)\
Final project for CMSE 201 class. Analyzed the scores given by the United Nations for its annual *World Happiness Report* for the years 2015-2019. Findings include: a strong correlation between a high GDP and high happiness score, and creating linear and quadratic models to determine the average happiness score for a global region in 2020 using mean squared error. That is, assuming the Covid-19 pandemic did not happen. Created using Python and presented via a Jupyter Notebook.

[eFed website](https://github.com/leenoah390/leenoah390.github.io) (Sep 2023-Present)\
I run a pro-wrestling eFed as a hobby using the video game *Fire Pro Wrestling World* and built a simple [website](https://leenoah390.github.io/) to display my eFed's championships and lineages. Used basic html to create the pages. Also built a [couple Python scripts](https://github.com/leenoah390/fpww_roster_builder) to create a static roster page to display wrestler images for your own eFed.
